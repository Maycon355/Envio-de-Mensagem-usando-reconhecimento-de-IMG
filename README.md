Hi Devs,

I developed this application to send messages through whatsapp, using the selenium and webdriver libraries.

Project takes the following steps:

It reads the SQL to identify which customers will receive, message in case I deliver all invoiced for the day.

After identifying the customers, he opens Google Chrome and starts sending message by message to the customers, notifying them that their order has been invoiced.

It uses image recognition, a smarter bot so there are no errors when sending.

The Bot has a Log system to identify the status of messages.
